          The school explored three back-to-school models: a full return, a
          hybrid return (partial in school, partial out of school), and a fully
          remote return.
        </p>
        <p class="mb3">
          <b
            >The district made the decision to move forward with the hybrid plan
            because they think that it's important for students to see each
            other & their teachers in-person.</b
          >
          They acknowledge that it's possible transmission rates will increase &
          they will have to return to a fully-remote model.
        </p>
        <p class="mb3">
          <b
            >The hybrid model makes use of two groups of students: Cardinal &
            Navy. Cardinal will attend school on Monday & Wednesday, while Navy
            will attend on Tuesday & Thursday.</b
          >
          Siblings will be placed in the same cohort so that transportation is
          easier. Fridays will likely be a half-day, alternating between
          Cardinal & Navy each week.
        </p>
        <p class="mb3">
          They opted for students coming two to three times a week vs. one week
          of school on/one off because the district thinks that it's more
          difficult to keep students engaged and connected to their learning +
          teachers with more time between classes. They acknowledge that the
          COVID-19 transmission rate could potentially be lower with the
          one-week on, one-week off plan.
        </p>
        <p class="mb3">
          When a student isn't in school during the week, they'll be
          participating in an "at-home" day. During an "at-home" day, students
          will continue to work on what they were taught during in-class days.
          No new material will be taught. Middle school students will be given
          up to 5 hours of work & high school students up to 7 hours of work.
        </p>
        <p class="mb3">
          Students who cannot come into school will have the option to take part
          in the Westborough Stand-Alone Remote Learning Program. The WSRLP is
          still under development, but the district envisions an online learning
          program run by teachers from Westborough & neighboring towns who can't
          teach in-person due to medical reasons.
        </p>
        <p class="mb3">
          They are still developing safety plans, and have written up a
          tentative report
